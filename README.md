# UCI-HAR-dataet
Cleaning and tidying data of HAR dataset

This repository conains 4 files:
- run_analysis.r : the r program that does the analysis and produces the resulting dataset
- summary_measures.txt : the resulting dataset
- CodeBook.md : explanation for origin of datan, quality problems, how they were solved and the resulting dataset
- the present Readme.md

For run_analysid.r to work properly, you have to download the orginal dataset and unzip it in the same directory as the r program.
This should produce the summary_measures.txt file, that is the tidy dataset that summarise some data from orginal work.

You should read detailed explanations in CodeBook.md.
